# Apply Bevy Coding Standards

## Process

1. **Check Current Changes**

   - Run `git status` to see what files have been modified
   - Review the changes being made or check previous chat history to summarize the changes
   - Understand the context: what features/systems are being added or modified?

2. **Search Bevy Examples for Standards**

   - Using the summary of changes, identify key terms and concepts (e.g., "camera", "sprite", "systems", "resources", "UI", "input handling")
   - Search for these terms in `docs/bevy_examples/docs/` to find relevant Bevy examples
   - Review the examples to understand Bevy best practices and idiomatic patterns for the specific feature being implemented

3. **Apply Standards**
   - Refactor the code to follow Bevy conventions found in the examples
   - Ensure consistency with Bevy's ECS patterns, naming conventions, and architectural approaches
